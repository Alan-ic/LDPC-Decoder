# LDPC-Decoder
This repository contains an LDPC soft decision decoder using MATLAB and C++. 

The repository uses already established LDPC Parity Check Matrices to simulate their performance in MATLAB.

C++ code was used to create the graph matrix required to decode and encoded message. 

To utilize the C++ code, please make sure that you have a MATLAB compatible C++ compiler on your computer you
can utilize mex.

For supported MATLAB compilers: https://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/previous_releases.html

With the environment setup: use "mex soft_decoder.cpp" to compile the code and an executable will show
up in the folder, which will contain the function used in MATLAB.

Parity Matrix, H and Generator Matrix, G are the provided example matrices. 

More parity matrices can be found from: http://www.uni-kl.de/en/channel-codes/channel-codes-database/wimax-ldpc/
and http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/codes/data.html. They are stored as alist files. 

To convert alist files to H and G, modified perl scripts from http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/perl/ are provided. Make sure that perl is installed on your computer. It should be on most linux distros. For windows users: https://learn.perl.org/installing/windows.html

Generating Parity Matrix from Alist file:
  a. Given an alist file “wimax_576_0.5.alist”, parity matrix is generated by running:
    i. perl A2H_2.pas wimax_576_0.5.alist
    This will create a parity matrix file called “H”.
  b. Given the parity matrix “H”, the generator matrix is generated by running:
    i. perl G2H.p Gfile=H writeH=G
    This will create a generator matrix file called “G”
